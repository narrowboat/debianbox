This is another SLiM (Simple Login Manager) theme. It is based off of DevilX's splashy theme found here:
http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/LinuxOsX+Splashy+Theme?content=72225

and Minimal-Tux SLiM Theme found here :
http://www.box-look.org/content/show.php/Minimal-Tux+SLiM+Theme?content=99148

Themes are stored in:
/usr/share/slim/themes

SLiM configurations are stored in:
/etc/slim.conf

FYI: If you have a -really- long username, the text will "cut off". To fix this, simply change the font size values in the theme file to a smaller one of your choice.

Enjoy
